This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to asynchronous DOM manipulation in HTML.  The bug occurs when a script tries to interact with a div element before it's fully parsed and added to the DOM. This results in either a JavaScript error (if strict mode is used) or unexpected behavior (if not). The solution showcases how to use the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure the script executes after the DOM is ready. This ensures proper DOM element access and prevents issues.
